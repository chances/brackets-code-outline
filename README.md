#Brackets Code Outline

This extension to the Brackets editor is to help produce a code outline similar to the one in Eclipse.

**This extension is currently not ready to use. This message will be removed once the developer is ready for others to start testing.**

The extension will be developed in the following way:
- Basic outline of CSS rules in CSS files
- Basic outlining of functions, classes, and namespaces for PHP files
- Basic outlining of functions and objects for JavaScript files
- More advanced outlining for each of the above
- Outlining for SASS (SCSS to start) files

After the above tasks are complete, further ideas will be developed.

Also, the ability to position this extension along the side was found with the help of the [WD Minimap](https://github.com/websiteduck/brackets-wdminimap "WD Minimap") extension.
